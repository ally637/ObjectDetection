#ObjectDetection
A starter's guide to Object Detection and Learning

##Scope of the Project

This project classifies three different object categories viz. 
**Coins**
, 
**Keys** 
and 
**Pendrive**
. From the training images it learns all the features of these
 objects. Then, when new test image is given for testing, it identifies them. 
 In case it misinterprets the object with other item, we can always reinforce it and 
 improve our learning model.

##Terms You Need To Know About
```
**SIFT**  
For feature extraction
**K-means Clustering**  
For decreasing number of features by creating Bag of Visual Words
**SVM Classifier (SMO Optimization)**  
For classification of images
```

##Project coded in Matlab
There are two folders viz. Project-CLI and Project-GUI. You can copy the images from Project-GUI to Project-CLI and start working with the Command Line version of the project.
