#ObjectDetection
A starter's guide to Object Detection and Learning

##Scope of the Project

This project classifies three different object categories viz. 
**Coins**
, 
**Keys** 
and 
**Pendrive**
. From the training images it learns all the features of these
 objects. Then, when new test image is given for testing, it identifies them. 
 In case it misinterprets the object with other item, we can always reinforce it and 
 improve our learning model.
